# Stats

Current configuration provides news story sentiment analysis (using a web based Machine Learning Sentiment API) for Major League Soccer players. (league roster from 2015)

1. Gets list of players and their stats from a csv.
2. Uses Bing News Search to find stories related to specific players.
3. Prints summary of stories to console.
4. Uses Microsoft Cognitive Services machine learning API to analyze stories for positive or negative sentiment.
5. Prints sentiment rating, as a percent positive, to console in front of summary.

Program includes methods to print stats of selected or all players.  Requires reconfiguration of Program.cs to do so.

Not currently interested in expanding on this project.  
Leaving up for reference.
